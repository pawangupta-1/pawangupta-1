Hi! I am Pawan. I study Human Development and Education.
And work as an RA at Computational Cognitive Development Lab @Harvard. 
This is an effort to document my learning while trying to solve a peculiar problem.
The idea is to reduce human effort and time required in segmenting, transcripting and analysing audio recordings for acoustic-prosidic features 
to study how parent-child interaction affects children's learning.
I am completely new to Github and the world of coding as well as to the acoustic analysis. But let see what I learn during this project. I am excited!
